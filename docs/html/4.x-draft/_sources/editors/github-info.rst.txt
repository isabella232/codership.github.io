=============================
The Codership GitHub
=============================

All of the files, the documents and articles |---| the source code |---| of the Codership Library are maintained at GitHub in a repository.  The URL is `https://github.com/codership/documentation <https://github.com/codership/documentation>`_.

This source code includes our Documentation, Knowledge Base articles, an FAQ, and the Release Notes for our product releases. These files at GitHub use the Sphinx Python Documentation Generator. Each document is written with the reStructuredText, a lightweight mark-up language (see :doc:`reStructuredText <./restructured-text>`).

Although the repository is open to the public and anyone can download the files for their own use, we do not accept changes from the public due to our concerns about copyrights.  However, we do welcome feedback and comments related to the content.  On the GitHub site, we provide an email address (`library@galeracluster.com`) for sending us suggestions |---| the editors are copied on that email alias.
