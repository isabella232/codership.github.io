We will show the advantages of having a geo-distributed database cluster and how to create one using Galera Cluster for MySQL. We will also discuss the configuration and status variables that are involved and how to deal with typical situations on the WAN such as slow, untrusted or unreliable links, latency and packet loss. We will demonstrate a multi-region cluster on Amazon EC2 and perform some throughput and latency measurements in real-time.
