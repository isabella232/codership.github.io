This video provides the practical aspects of migrating a database setup based on traditional asynchronous replication to multi-master Galera Cluster. We will discuss the benefits Galera provides and how traditional replication settings, architecture and practices can be converted to Galera Cluster. We will show the steps that are needed to perform the migration with limited or no downtime, and will demonstrate the procedure in practice using a live database with an actual workload.
