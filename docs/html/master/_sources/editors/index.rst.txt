The Codership Library was reorganized recently to make it easier to find information on Galera Cluster. This includes the introduction of a knowledge base containing troubleshooting and best practices articles, as well as tutorial articles and training videos.

This has been quite an extensive project.  As such, we've added here plans of how we'll further organize and expand these primary sections of the Library, as well as an editorial calendar of the publication of articles and other resources.

On the right are two pie charts representing data from Google, depicting the percentage of user impressions and clicks for the Library. Below are brief summaries of each section of the Library and links to more detailed information.
