======================================
The Codership Library Mission & Goals
======================================

Our mission for the Codership Library is to update and improve the Documentation, to build and develop a Knowledge Base of Troubleshooting and Best Practices articles, to address all common questions of prospective users in the FAQ, and to write a robust collection of tutorial articles and videos for the Training section.

.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: Documentation

This section is the documentation for Galera Cluster. This is straightforward documentation, not tutorials or advice articles. See below for those. The documentation includes hundreds of pages of information on configuring every aspect of Galera (i.e., Reference Manual), as well as information on administering a cluster (i.e., Administration Manual).

.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: Knowledge Base

Occasionally, you may have problems getting a cluster to work the way you want. Maybe you’ll may have a node that just won’t join the cluster. Or a node or the cluster crashes. The Knowledge Base provides Troubleshooting articles explaining how to resolve common problems. It also contains Best Practices articles for improving performance, ensuring against crashes, and other methods for getting the most out of Galera.

.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: Frequently Asked Questions

This section is the FAQ for Galera Cluster. It lists a number of frequently asked questions on Galera and other related matters. They’re not for solving problems. Instead, they’re mostly questions that you might have before deciding to use Galera software, as well as how to get assistance and learn about Galera.

.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: Training

This is our training section. It contains a Getting Started Guide , as well as articles using Galera for specific uses. Soon there will also be videos of training seminars and other presentations.
