The Codership Knowledge Base
=============================

:doc:`The Codership Documentation <../documentation/index>` explains in detail how to deploy and administer a Galera Cluster. This section, the Codership Knowledge Base (KB) contains information on resolving problems and improving use of Galera Cluster.  Here you'll find troubleshooting articles and best practices articles, and answers to frequently asked questions.

In essence, the Documentation is how to use Galera assuming everything goes according to plan; the KB is for when things don't go as expected or when they could be better.
