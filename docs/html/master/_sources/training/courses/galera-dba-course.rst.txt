   .. rubric:: Hours

   The typical schedule for this course is four hours a day for three consecutive days.  There will be five to ten minute breaks each hour.  The scheduling is generally suited for either the U.S. or for Europe.

   So classes may begin around 8:30 a.m. San Francisco time, ending around 12:30 p.m. each day.  That allows for students on the U.S. East coast to take the course from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m., New York time.  To accomodate European students, courses are offered occasionally starting at 8:30 a.m., London time.
