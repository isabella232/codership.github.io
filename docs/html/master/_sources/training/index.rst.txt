This is the training section of the Codership Library. Here you'll find tutorial articles to start.  Our plan is to create a series of articles and videos to help you learn about Galera Cluster and related software--in conjunction with Galera. Soon there will be plenty here; for now, this is just the start.

Some people prefer to read, while others prefer screencast videos.  We have several in this format on Galera Cluster and related software; we're adding new ones every month. They're professionally made presentations, with an experieced instructor voice-over. Some parts are easy to follow slides, and for some parts there are demonstrations of how to configure and use the software.
