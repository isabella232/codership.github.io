===================================================
The Galera Manager
===================================================

The Galera Manager is a graphical user interface for creating and provisioning Galera Clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows an administrator to add nodes easily, and without having to configure each node, manually. Perhaps more useful is that Galera Manager provides charts for monitoring host and database metrics to ensure the proper and efficient functioning of a Galera Cluster.  There are over a thousand metrics from which to choose.  You may use any standard web browser for accessing Galera Manager, to administer and monitor clusters.

This section of the Codership documentation provides detailed information and instructions on how to install and configure Galera Manager.  Below is a brief summary of each aspects of the process to start using Galera Manager, with each heading linked to the related page for much more information |---| there are also links in the margin to all pages of the Galera Manager documentation. However, if you're an advanced administrator and are confident in your abilities, this page will provide you a summary of what you need to install and start using Galera Manager.

.. _`galera-manager-install-steps`:
.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: :doc:`Install Galera Manager <./gmd-install>`

The *Galera Manager Installer* is used to install Galera Manager.  There are a few steps to installing with the *Installer*.  This section is only a brief summary of those steps.  Some of this text contain links to other pages where you'll find more detailed information on each step.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading indented
   .. rubric:: Choose or Create an *Installer Host*

   You will need a server or other computer on which to download the *Installer* and then to run it to install the Gallera Manager.  You may use a local computer (e.g., a desktop or laptop computer), but most administrators use an existing *AWS Instance* since Galera Manager was built to be used with AWS.

   Incidentally, at this point, Galera Manager runs either Ubuntu or Amazon Linux 2. Future releases of Galera Manager may allow for other distributions of Linux. For now, it's recommended you use one of these two distributions for the *Installer Host*. Galera Manager will, however, generate hosts that will use either Ubuntu or CentOS and nodes that will run on MySQL or MariaDB.


   .. rst-class:: sub-heading indented
   .. rubric:: Download the *Installer*

   After you've prepared a server to be the *Installer Host*, you'll need to download the *Installer* from Codership's site.  Currently, only the beta version of Galera Manager is available. Eventually, you'll be able to find a link to it on `Codership's Download page <https://galeracluster.com/downloads/>`_.  Until then, log onto your server and use an FTP program, or a utility like ``wget`` to download the installation package for the *Installer* at this address:

      `https://galeracluster.com/galera-manager/gm-installer <https://galeracluster.com/galera-manager/gm-installer>`_.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading indented
   .. rubric:: Run the *Installer*

   Once the *Installer* has been downloaded, you can run it to install Galera Manager. Youâ€™ll have to provide some basic information: an administrative password, as well as a domain name and a site certificate, if you have these and want to use them.

   When you're finished, the `gmd` daemon will be running on the *Installer Host*. Then you may use this server to deploy a Galera Cluster.

Check the :doc:`gmd-install` documentation page for much more details on using the *Installer* and explanatons of the questions you'll be asked, as well as suggestions on how to respond to them. You might also read the :doc:`gmd` page.


.. _`galera-manager-deploying-steps`:
.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: :doc:`Deploying a Cluster <./galera-manager-adding-clusters>`

Having installed Galera Manager, you're now ready to use it to deploy a Galera Cluster, including adding hosts and configuring nodes.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: Access Galera Manager

   In the address field of your web browser, enter the address of your *Installer Host*, prefixed with ``https://``.  The address you would enter, though, would be either a domain name or an IP address, depending on what you designated when you installed Galera Manager.

   If you didn't provide a certificate, your web browser may try to protect you from accessing the address. Push past those warnings until you reach the login screen. Then enter the administrative user name and password you gave when installing.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: Create a Cluster & Add Nodes

   After you log into Galera Manager, you may create a cluster, and then add hosts and nodes |---| hosts being *AWS Instances*, and nodes being MySQL or MariaDB servers (i.e., ``mysqld``).  Typically, one would start with three nodes |---| you can add more nodes later, or delete some if you added too many. Remember, AWS may charge your AWS account based on the number of *Instances* you have running, as well as usage on each host.  When you create a cluster, be sure to provide an public encryption key.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: :doc:`Secure the Ports <./galera-manager-ports>`

   When first adding hosts, all ports used by Galera Cluster and the database engine, including the administrator (i.e., ``ssh``) are open from any IP address. Someone will still need login credentials to access the hosts, but you may want to tighten the *Inbound Rules* on AWS. You'll find more information on *Inbound Rules* on the :doc:`galera-manager-ports` page.

You can find more details on deploying a cluster on the :doc:`galera-manager-adding-clusters` and the :doc:`galera-manager-adding-nodes` documentation pages. You may also find the :doc:`galera-manager-adding-users` page helpful at some point.


.. _`galera-manager-loading-cluster`:
.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: :doc:`Load Initial Data <./galera-manager-initializing-data>`

After installing and setting up your first Galera Cluster, you'll need to load your data into the cluster.  There are a few ways by which you can do this. Two of the most common methods are highlighted below.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: Get Login Details

   To load the initial data, you'll need to get the login creditials (i.e., user name, host address, password) for accessing one of the nodes with a MySQL client. This can be found by clicking on one of the nodes in Galera Manager, then its Configuration tab.  There you'll find the *DB Address* and the *DB Root Password* for accessing the database system.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: Back-Up & Load Data

   Assuming you have an existing MySQL database on a server somewhere, you'll need to make a back-up of its databases and then load it onto one of the new nodes to jump start Galera Cluster.  The most common methods are to use a ``mysqldump`` generated dump file, or use a utility like ``rsync`` to make a physical copy of the data directory.

   If you're using a dump file, copy it to the *Installer Host* and then use a MySQL client (e.g., ``mysql``) to load the data into MySQL or MariaDB on one of the nodes. If you made a physical copy of the data to a zipped archived file, tranfer it to one of the new nodes, stopping the node temporarily on Galera Manager while you do.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: Ready for Normal Usage

   After the initial data has finished loading, you may access and change data in MySQL with any MySQL client.  You may also access the data using any application you would normally use (e.g., PHP scripts accessed by end-users through a web browser).

For more details on how to use the methods mentioned above for loading data, see the :doc:`galera-manager-initializing-data` documentation page.


.. _`galera-manager-managing-cluster`:
.. rst-class:: section-heading
.. rubric:: :doc:`Monitor a Cluster <./galera-manager-monitoring-clusters>`

With a Galera Cluster and nodes in place, including the data loaded and accessible to users, you can monitor your cluster using charts of database and host metrics in Galera Manager. Still, you may want to configure these charts or add more to suit your particular needs.

   .. rst-class:: sub-heading
   .. rubric:: Configure Charts

   By default, there are a few charts configured for commonly watched metrics.  However, there are over one-thousand metrics that you may track.  Click on the cluster in Galera Manager and you'll see the default charts. You may click the *X* at the top right of any chart to remove it.  To add a chart, click the vertical ellipsis to access a pull-down menu where you can select *Add Chart*. A dialog box will appear for you to choose the metric you want to monitor.

For more information on adding charts and related information, see the :doc:`galera-manager-monitoring-clusters` documentation page.
